# Author Identification

A web-app based on the paper, _[Effectivness of Doc2Vec in Authorship Identification Tasks](https://cedricconol.github.io/doc2vec/)_, by Cedric Conol and Rosely Pe√±a.

### Prerequisites

Though not necessary, I advise using a virtual environment. 

### Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/cedricconol/author-identification
cd author-identification
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the app

```
streamlit run app.py
```
